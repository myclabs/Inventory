# User module

## User

Create a user:

```php
$user = $userService->createUser($email, $password);
$entityManager->flush();
```

Invite a user by email:

```php
$user = $userService->inviteUser($email);
$entityManager->flush();
```

Delete a user:

```php
$user = $userService->deleteUser($user);
$entityManager->flush();
```

## ACL

You give access rights to a user by adding it a role:

```php
$user->addRole(new CellAdministrator($user, $cell));
```

Test access rights:

```php
$userService->isAllowed($user, Action::EDIT(), $resource);
// or
$resource->isAllowed($user, Action::EDIT());
```

### Extending

#### Creating a new kind of resource

You need to have your entity implement the `Resource` interface:

```php
class Article extends Resource
{
    use ResourceTrait;

    /**
     * @var ArticleAuthorization[]|Collection
     */
    protected $acl;

    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->acl = new ArrayCollection();
    }
}
```

```yaml
Article\Domain\Article:
  type: entity

  oneToMany:
    acl:
      targetEntity: Article\Domain\ACL\ArticleAuthorization
      mappedBy: resource
      cascade: [ all ]
      orphanRemoval: true
```

To create authorizations on the new resource, you need to create a new kind of authorization:

```php
class ArticleAuthorization extends Authorization
{
}
```

and map its `resource` field:

```yaml
Article\Domain\ACL\ArticleAuthorization:
  type: entity

  manyToOne:
    resource:
      targetEntity: Article\Domain\Article
      inversedBy: acl
```

#### Creating a new role

To create a new role, extend the `Role` abstract class:

```php
class ArticleEditorRole extends Role
{
    protected $article;

    public function __construct(User $user, Article $article)
    {
        $this->article = $article;
        // See remark below
        $article->addEditorRole($this);

        parent::__construct($user);
    }

    public function buildAuthorizations()
    {
        $this->authorizations->clear();

        ArticleAuthorization::create($this, $this->user, Action::VIEW(), $this->article);
        ArticleAuthorization::create($this, $this->user, Action::EDIT(), $this->article);
    }
}
```

If the role is related to a resource, the association between the resource (`Article`)
and the role (`ArticleEditorRole`) needs to be bidirectional so that the Delete Cascade of Doctrine works
when the Article is deleted.

#### Keeping the authorizations up to date

When a user, or a resource is deleted, authorizations will be deleted in cascade by Doctrine.

### Rebuilding authorizations

To manually rebuild all the authorizations:

```php
$userService->rebuildAuthorizations();
```

This is generally not needed, authorizations are automatically updated.
